# PromptAll - Send prompts to different AI's
You can send prompts to websites - Bing Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude.ai, and the VSCode extension - GitHub Copilot.

## Why 
- Sometimes, an answer from an AI website/extension does not solve the problem, and another AI gives a better answer.
- Entering prompts to multiple AI's is time-consuming.
- Sending a prompt to all AI programs and being able to see the results simultaneously, can save you a lot of time.

## How to use
- When the program starts you need to log in to Claude ai, Bing Copilot and ChatGPT
- For the GitHub Copilot extension, ensure that you have Visual Studio Code installed with the GitHub Copilot extension, and that you have an active subscription to GitHub Copilot.
- You have to open Github Copilot extension by hand - unfortunately. You can open chat in editor, so that it appears full frame.
- After that, enjoy sending prompts and seeing results from different AI's.
- Press Shift+Enter to create a new line, press Enter to submit.

## Known Issues
- Currently, the application requires you to log in again after closing and reopening it.
- No way to select which AI programs to open, currently it opens all of them.
- If you don't have GitHub Copilot installed, the application still attempts to open Visual Studio Code.
- You need to open Github Copilot extension yourself.
